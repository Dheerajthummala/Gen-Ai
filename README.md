# 🔗 LangChain

LangChain is an open-source framework used to build AI-powered applications and agents.
It enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with external data sources such as company documents, personal files, databases, APIs, and vector stores.

Using prompts, chains, tools, and memory, LangChain helps generate accurate, context-aware responses based on the end-user or business requirements.
It is commonly used for:
Chatbots
Question–Answer systems
Document analysis
AI agents using custom data

# 🔗 LangGraph

LangGraph is an extended framework built on top of LangChain, designed for complex, multi-step, and stateful AI workflows.

It allows developers to create graph-based and cyclic execution flows, making it ideal for:
Multi-agent systems
Deep reasoning tasks

Research-based AI workflows

Scenarios where multiple documents or data sources must be combined to generate a single answer

For example, when there are multiple files containing different types of information, LangGraph helps orchestrate how the AI navigates, combines, and reasons across those sources using a graphical and cyclical pattern.
